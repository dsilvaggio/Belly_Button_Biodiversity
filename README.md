# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## Overview
  Bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins to taste like beef are used in many plant based meat substitutes. Improbable Beef, a food start-up, has partnered with microbiologists to search for and test bacterial species found inside human bellybuttons. It is probable that these species will lead to the next best beef substitute. A dashboard was created for both research participants and researchers to access that has information on the bacteria found by research participant ID number.
