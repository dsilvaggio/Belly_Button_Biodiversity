# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## Overview
  Bacterial species that can synthesize proteins to taste like beef are used in many plant-based meat substitutes. Improbable Beef, a food start-up, has partnered with microbiologists to search for and test bacterial species found inside human bellybuttons. It is probable that these species will lead to the next best beef substitute. A dashboard was created for both research participants and researchers to access that has information on the bacteria found by the research participant ID number.    

## Results
  Using JavaScript and Plotly, the user can select which research participant ID they are interested in and three charts will be displayed on the website along with demographic information. The demographic information can be seen on the left side of the page and contains the participant's id, ethnicity, gender, and other identifying factors. 
  
  The user will also see a bar chart containing the top 10 bacteria types found in the partipcants belly button along with the sample values. A bubble chart can be seen at the bottom of the page that display all the bacteria types in the participants belly button along with the sample values. The size of the bubbles equals the sample values so that users can easily see the bacteria types that were found in larger amounts in the partipcnats belly buton. The last chart displayed on the page shows the weekly washing frequency as a measure between 0 and 10. Users can move between the bar and bubble charts by using the naviagation bar at the top of the page.
